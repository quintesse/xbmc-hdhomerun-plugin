XBMC video plugin for HDHomerun
===============================

XBMC - http://xbmc.org/
HDHomerun - http://www.hdhomerun.com/

For now this plug-in ONLY works on Linux because of the following reasons
(besides the fact that I made and tested this plugin on Linux):

- The HDHomeRun library included with XBMC is not the version needed by
  this plugin so the newer version is actually included in the distribution.
  Only the Linux version is included.
  
Because of this dependency on binary module this plugin will probably
never accepted into the official repository as-is. (No binaries allowed)
